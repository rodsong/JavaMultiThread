 * synchronized keyword is used for exclusive accessing. To make a method
 * synchronized, simply add the synchronized keyword to its declaration. Then no
 * two invocations of synchronized methods on the same object can interleave
 * with each other. Synchronized statements must specify the object that
 * provides the intrinsic lock. When synchronized(this) is used, you have to
 * avoid to synchronizing invocations of other objects' methods. wait() tells
 * the calling thread to give up the lock and go to sleep (not polling) until
 * some other thread enters the same lock and calls notify(). notify() wakes up
 * the first thread that called wait() on the same object.
