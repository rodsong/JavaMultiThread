/**
 * CountDownLatch Java class to synchronize your threads’ activities.
 *
 * Source:
 * (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17827022/what-is-countdown-latch-in-java-multithreading)
 * Any thread, usually main thread of application, which calls
 * CountDownLatch.await() will wait until count reaches zero or its interrupted
 * by another thread. All other thread are required to do count down by calling
 * CountDownLatch.countDown() once they are completed or ready.
 *
 * As soon as count reaches zero, Thread awaiting starts running. One of the
 * disadvantage of CountDownLatch is that its not reusable once count reaches to
 * zero you can not use CountDownLatch any more.
 *
 * Use CountDownLatch when one thread like main thread, require to wait for one
 * or more thread to complete, before it can start processing.
 *
 * Classical example of using CountDownLatch in Java is any server side core
 * Java application which uses services architecture, where multiple services
 * are provided by multiple threads and application can not start processing
 * until all services have started successfully.
